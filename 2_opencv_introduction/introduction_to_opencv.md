# Introduction to OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) library that includes several hundreds of computer vision library. The library is provided in c++ and has [application programming interfaces (API)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) in Python and some other languages. In this class, we will focus on the Python APIs. Since OpenCV is a library for computer vision, it is necessary that we understand some computer vision concepts. We will only explain concepts that are used in this class. Please feel free to read about other concepts or theories that interest you.

> Note: If something is not clear or you need a deeper explanation of a concept. Please do not hesitate to request for the topic so that it can be added to instruction material.


## What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is a field of science that deals with how computers can gain high-level understnading from digital images or videos. This field aims to understand and automate the tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision tasks includes but are not limited to the following;

1. Image processing
2. Scene reconstruction
4. Object recognition
5. Object tracking
6. 3D pose estimation
7. Learning
8. Indexing
9. Motion estimation
10. 3D scene modeling
11.
