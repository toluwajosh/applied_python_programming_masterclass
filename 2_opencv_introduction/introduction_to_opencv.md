# Introduction to OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) library that includes several hundreds of computer vision library. The library is provided in c++ and has [application programming interfaces (API)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) in Python and some other languages. In this class, we will focus on the Python APIs. Since OpenCV is a library for computer vision, it is necessary that we understand some computer vision concepts. We will only explain concepts that are used in this class. Please feel free to read about other concepts or theories that interest you.

> Note: If something is not clear or you need a deeper explanation of a concept. Please do not hesitate to request for the topic so that it can be added to instruction material.
