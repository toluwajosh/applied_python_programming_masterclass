# This is the main heading of the material

Here is a general introduction to the material and the contents

## This is a subheading

Here is an explanation of the subheading. Each material will have several subheadings.

The following is a code snippet. The typeface is different from the rest of the material.

```python
import numpy as np # assumes that you already installed numpy
print("Hello World")
print("Here is a random number from numpy: ",
        np.random.random())
```

The following is another code snippet, but should be run in a `Python Interactive Shell`. Note that the line with `>>>` is the line to be typed in, the next line after that is the output.

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> print("Hello World")
Hello World
>>> np.random.random()
0.42035286548907713
```

> This is a side explanation. It is meant to explain more about a term or idea that has been mentioned in the material.
