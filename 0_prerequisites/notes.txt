# Notes

Programming telling a computer exactly what to do in a step by step layout of instructions.
With suitable Programming, each computer can basically do all the things that any other computer can do.

Reasons to learn programming
Programming makes you be in control of your computer
Programming can be a fun hobby
Programming helps to develop valuabe problem solving skills such as the ability to analyze complex systems by reducing them to interactions of understandable subsystems
Programming is a lucrative career option
Programming gives you an edge regardless of your occupation

Algorithm is a step-be-step process of acheiving a desired result.

Three main techniques in computer science; design, analysis and experimentation

Analysis is the process of examining algorithms and problems mathematically.

Some probems are too complex or ill-defined to lend themselves to analysis. In such cases, computer scientists rely on experimentation; they actually implement systems and then study the resulting behaviour.

Functional view of a computer: [input devices]>[[cpu]<>[main memory]]>[output devices]-<>[secondary memory]

Some examples of general computing; networking, human-computer interaction, AI, software engineering, web and multimedia design, management informaition systems, and computer security.

Programming Languages:
A code for writing down the instructions that a computer will follow. The process of writing an algorithm in a programming language si called coding.

A high level language can either be compiled or interpreted
