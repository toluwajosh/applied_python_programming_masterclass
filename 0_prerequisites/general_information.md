# General Information

Welcome to the Applied Python Programming Masterclass - Build OCR App with Python.

## Introduction

The objective of this masterclass is to build an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) app with python. At the end of this class, you will have built an app that can take a picture of a printed document using a webcam, recognize the words written in the document and write it to a text file.

This same technology is applied in;

- Automatic captions recognition from images
- Plate number recognition from traffic cameras
- Conversion of PDFs to word documents
- Automatic handwriting and digit recognition
- Automatic Captchas and street signs recognition

In this class, The following areas will be covered:

- Python Object Oriented Programming
- OpenCV, used Â for computer vision applications
- Building a web app with the Django framework
- Serving the web apps with Heroku

## Duration

As this class is still in the development phase, the total duration needed to finish the class cannot be ascertained. However, it should be between 4 to 8 weeks. All all materials will be available at once, the time it takes a particular student totally depends on the individual. For students with busy schedule and would like to take class in a consistent manner. You are advised to plan to spend about 5 to 10 hours per week on the class.

## Set up

To ascertain uniformity in experience for all students, the following are preferred resources the student need to prepare.

1. Operating System Platform: If possible, a Ubuntu linux environment is best. If not, Windows is the next best option.
2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): This is software you will use to write most of your code. Be sure to install VSCode as this is the preferred option.
3. Python Package Management: This is the software to manage python packages. Install Anaconda as the python package management software. This will ensure that you have all the needed libraries that will be used in the class.

If you do not have this set up yet, watch the video on [Getting Started in Python with VSCode and Anaconda](https://youtu.be/MZsdGUsPzuE), Note that you can use any tool you prefer, however, we will only be able to provide support if you use the recommended tools.
